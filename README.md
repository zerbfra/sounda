# Sounda - Simple SoundBoard for Mac

![Sounda](Sounda/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/sounda128.png)


I was struggling to find a sound board for mac, and I didn't find anything simple or cheap on the Mac App Store.

I came up with this simple software for mac, written in a couple of hours in a rainy night.

* Any of the button can be associated to one sound. 
* By pressing each button you will play the sound through the selected audio device.

_The "AudioDeviceList" class was probably originally written by Apple, but I'm not sure. If you find out that it's yours, please write me and I will add the copyrights ;) I don't even remember if I modified something or not._

The Sounda icon is based on the design of Alessandro Suraci, available at [NounProject](https://thenounproject.com/term/sound-wave/6000/)
